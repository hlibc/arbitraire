	\`confiscator' -- an automatic configuration system for use with C,
	C++ and assembly code. It is based on gmake the GNU imeplementation
	of make.


        This configuration system honors the ARCH variable for assembly code
	specific directories. The architecture is not automatically detected
	by the configure script, but can be passed to the makefile as follows:

	./configure ARCH='archhere'

	confiscator needs its own configuration file named \".config\" in order
	to accomplish its generic goals. It should contain the following fields

	projectname=\"\"                     The name of the project
	copyright=\"\"                       The project author and copyright info
	prefixtype=\"\"                      The installation prefix
	description=\"\"                     A description of the project
	libname=\"\"                         The name of the library

	Source code files ending with .c or .cpp should be placed under a directory
	named src/. Includes should be in their own directory that is based on 
	the library name. Executables intended to test the library should be placed
	under tests/. Assembly files ending with .s should be placed under
	src/$(ARCH)/ corresponding to the architecure they are written for. A
	typical layout might look as follows:

	src/function1.c
            function2.c

	src/x86_64/function3.s
                   function4.s

        src/i386/function5.s
                 function6.s

        tests/executable1.c
              executable2.c

        include/projectname/header1.h
                            header2.h
            

	The system is left as simple as possible so that the developer can add code
	corresponding to their needs. One change assembly programmers will likely
	want to make is to add a system for detecting the target architecture.
	The best way to do this is to use cc -dumpmachine and a case statement to
	match architectures you are using.
